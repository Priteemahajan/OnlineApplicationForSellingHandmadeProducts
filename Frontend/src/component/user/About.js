                <p>We hope to be able to raise the dignity of the Indian artisan in our own small way.</p>
                <p>It is our effort to offer an undeniably unique selection of traditional art 
                    and craft translated into a range of attractive contemporary products, 
                    while ensuring a fair price for every single artisan whose creations 
                    have been featured on this portal, while bringing it closer to people across the world. </p>
                <p>We endeavour to support our artisans not just by promoting what they make, 
                    but also by helping them with ideas and designs to innovate and create relevant 
                    craft products that appeal to changing tastes and modern preferences, to help them find wider markets.</p>
                <p>We actively undertake design and development of customised craft orders, 
                    working closely in with customers to understand, design and develop exclusive 
                    and classic craft-based solutions.</p>
                <p>The Handcraft Craft essentially seeks to contribute to preserving and promoting the unparalleled
                    artistic and cultural legacy inherited by every citizen of this amazing land.</p>
